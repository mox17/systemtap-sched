Program usage:

A file with scheduling traces is needed.

Run like this

./stsched.py --bucket=250000000 --duration=60 --merge --summary=sum.csv --output=table.csv scheduling.dat

The sample buckets are 250ms wide, stop after 60 seconds (as indicated by timestamps in file), merge processes with same names.
